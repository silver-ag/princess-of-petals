when the death flash is happening, if you leave the room the camera doesn't follow - which also means the room ypu fall into isn't handled and you fall through floors etc
the problem appears to be that in frames where need_full_redraw is set the game can't move to other rooms.
it's not clear why. the processing code for need_full_redraw in seg000 puts the two on seperate branches, but it's not arbitrary, just changing that doesn't fix it.

johnny music in shrine (maybe my own version??)

touga duel:
giant touga in the sky turns around on the first screen. then in the second, bg colour has changed. he descends from above, flashing and impaled,
and draws his sword from you. he's indestructible, but each time you hit him a tile wobbles and falls. at first they're behind you, but eventually
one goes behind him. this allows you to climb down one of the holes behind you, move past him on the floor below and climb back up to reach the final gate.

add spinning rose frame at start of each duel (also allow for sword drawing intro)

add nice edge rooms to each level

stop left gate back pillar showing in front of you while climbing up - don't know why this is, it still happens with draw_left_gate_fore disabled entirely

put crashed sportscar on other side top floor level 7

fix bug where tapping a key repeatedly while holding shift causes it to be input when shift is released?
