fix bug where tapping a key repeatedly while holding shift causes it to be input when shift is released?

bug: silhouette mode fucks up the cutscene

remove timer

add shadow sword to shadow girl guard hit sprites

make bell quieter

pause controls at start of level 7 to make chuchu more obvious
also, chuchu sound effect

make touga a harder fight (swap guard type w anthy? just make 100% first block?)

after everything else: remove all unused resources
