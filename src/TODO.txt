when the death flash is happening, if you leave the room the camera doesn't follow - which also means the room ypu fall into isn't handled and you fall through floors etc
the problem appears to be that in frames where need_full_redraw is set the game can't move to other rooms.
it's not clear why. the processing code for need_full_redraw in seg000 puts the two on seperate branches, but it's not arbitrary, just changing that doesn't fix it.

check diff into fix gate bg for graphics stuff i've added

add gate topper tile
